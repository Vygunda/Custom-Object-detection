# Custom Object Detection Project

## Overview
This project involves developing a custom object detection system capable of identifying 20 different classes of objects in both images and live video streams. The system is built using the YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once version 5) model, integrated with Python, OpenCV, Streamlit, and WebRTC.

## Features
- **Custom Object Detection**: Detects 20 predefined object classes.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Processes live video feeds for real-time object detection.
- **Image Detection**: Analyzes and detects objects in static images.
- **Web Application**: Provides a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.
- **Live Video Streaming**: Supports live video streaming and detection via WebRTC.

## Technologies Used
- **YOLOv5**: A state-of-the-art object detection algorithm for real-time object detection in images and videos.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for model development and integration.
- **OpenCV**: A computer vision library for processing images and video streams.
- **Streamlit**: A framework used to create the interactive web application.
- **WebRTC**: A real-time communication protocol used for live video streaming.
