**Custom Object Detection Project**
Overview
This project involves developing a custom object detection system capable of identifying 20 different classes of objects in both images and live video streams. The system is built using the YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once version 5) model, integrated with Python, OpenCV, Streamlit, and WebRTC.

Features
Custom Object Detection: Detects 20 predefined object classes.
Real-Time Detection: Processes live video feeds for real-time object detection.
Image Detection: Analyzes and detects objects in static images.
Web Application: User-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.
Live Video Streaming: Supports live video streaming and detection via WebRTC.
Technologies Used
YOLOv5: A state-of-the-art object detection algorithm that detects objects in images and videos in real-time.
Python: Primary programming language for model development and integration.
OpenCV: Library for computer vision tasks, such as processing images and video streams.
Streamlit: Framework for creating the interactive web application.
WebRTC: Real-time communication protocol for live video streaming.
